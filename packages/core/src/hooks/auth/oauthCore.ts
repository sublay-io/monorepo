 * Server-call head: POST to `/{projectId}/oauth/{authorize|link}` and return the

 *
 * - `authorize` is unauthenticated; `link` requires the caller's access token,
 *   passed via `accessToken` (sent as a Bearer header only when present).
 * - Throws an `Error` carrying the server's `error` body on a non-ok response.
 *
 * `link` resolves its token through the auth gate rather than trusting the
 * value the caller read, which is what makes it survive a cold start (the
 * caller's `accessToken` is still null while the bootstrap is in flight) and an
 * idle stretch (a token at or past `exp` is rotated before it goes out). It
 * throws if the active account changed while it waited, so the provider cannot
 * be linked to an account the caller never chose. This is a raw `fetch`, so
 * there is no interceptor to recover if the token is rejected anyway — same
 * limitation as the account-management thunks.
 *
 * `authorize` deliberately does NOT consult the gate: it is the sign-IN call,
 * and an armed gate returns whatever token is current rather than the null the
 * caller passed — which would attach the already-signed-in user's bearer to a
 * request that must go out unauthenticated.

 * reload, the value it restored was a pre-hydration `null` that clobbered the

 * callers instead — a deliberate asymmetry, documented on the OAuth pages.
